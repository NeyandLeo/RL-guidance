# Introduction

This repo aims to provide you with a simple implementation of all kinds of basic RL algorithms. The code is written in PyTorch and well-commented to help you understand the implementation details. The repo is still under development and more algorithms will be added soon. If you have any suggestions or find any bugs, please feel free to open an issue or submit a PR.

# Algorithms

- PPO: Proximal Policy Optimization.
  In here,we use PPO to solve the classic CartPole-v1 environment. The code is well-commented and easy to understand. You can run the code by simply executing the `PPO-cartpole.py` file.
  Docs can be found in [ppo_english.md](docs/ppo_english.md) ,中文版Docs为[ppo.md](docs/ppo.md)
- DQN: Deep Q Network.
  In here,we use DQN to solve a girdworld environment. The code is well-commented and easy to understand. You can run the code by simply executing the `DQN-gridworld.py` file.

# Future Work

I am a phd student in SJTU, MIFA lab，Jointly cultivated with Beijing Institute of General Artificial Intelligence. Due to the limited time, I will add more algorithms in the future. If you have any suggestions, please feel free to open an issue or submit a PR.
